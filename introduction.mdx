## When to Use Cregis APIs

Customers can choose between the Cregis terminal application or Cregis APIs to access Cregis services. The terminal application offers a user-friendly graphical interface suitable for operational management and low-frequency financial service applications. Cregis APIs, on the other hand, serve as the backend entry point for high-frequency financial services tailored for enterprises.
