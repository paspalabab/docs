1. Technical Validation Phase: During this phase, customers can swiftly grasp the primary functionalities of the API. Based on their business requirements, they can gain an in-depth understanding of the specific descriptions of API processes of interest and utilize the API debugging tool for rapid testing and validation.
2. Product Environment Integration Phase: Following technical validation, customers will have ample confidence to commence product integration for deploying actual product services. In this phase, customers need to first activate formal services and set up the formal product environment using the Cregis terminal application, configuring the corresponding interface environment parameters.
3. Operational Phase: Once the service enters the operational phase, if adjustments to the service are necessary, the aforementioned process can be repeated.

  Note: This document primarily focuses on the first phase, enabling developers to conduct technical integration and validation using this document and the API debugging tool without requiring business activation.
